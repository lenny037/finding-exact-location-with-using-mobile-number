This is an future planning of finding victim mobile number pinpoint location for using

This is an best way for find out the victim exact location\
Each host must share IP network space. Practically, this means that each host should have the 
same network address
Each host must have a unique IP address.
Neither host must block the other’s IP packets. (Host based packet filtering may hinder

This is concludes the tour of basic host networking and IP layer configuration as well as some

tricks, and more advanced content, keep reading.
Technicallly, the two hosts simply need to have routes to each other, but we are discussing 
the simplest case here, so we”ll leave this for a discussion of shared media.
