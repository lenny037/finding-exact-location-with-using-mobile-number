Let’s install some basic packages. To install packages in termux, the command used is: pkg install

Update and upgrade:
pkg update
pkg update && pkg upgrade
Installing Python:
pkg install python
For Python2
pkg install python2
For Python3
pkg install python3
Installing pip:
pkg install python-pip
Installing Git:
pkg install git
Installing wget:
pkg install wget
Uninstalling Packages:
pkg uninstall pkg-name
List all install packages:
pkg list-all

Installing Deb files:
You can similarly manage dpkg too. In case you’ve got a .deb file, you can’t install it using pkg install command. To install such a file, dpkg is used.
Installing:
dpkg -i ./package.deb
Uninstalling:
dpkg –remove [package name]
Listing all installed packages:
dpkg -l
Rest of the commands are almost the same as basic Debian Linux command line.

Graphical Environment setup:

To enable GUI support in termux, make sure you’ve VNC viewer or Xserver support installed on your device. I’d suggest a VNC viewer. It’s stable and a better choice for GUI. For a better experience use any third party hardware acceleration app as there is no such support available in termux by default.
As I mentioned above, the GUI support uses X11. The X11 packages are available in a separate repository. To enable X11 for GUI support run the following command:
pkg install x11-repo
And for further setup instructions, check this official wiki of termux.
