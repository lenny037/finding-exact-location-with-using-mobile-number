Tool-X is a python script which includes about 260+ hacking tools available in Kali Linux. This script can help you install most of these tools. But before proceeding, let me tell you I haven’t used this script so I don’t know the accuracy of it. So if it doesn’t work try to install the tools manually. Here is how to install Tool X:
Update, install git (if you haven’t installed git package, skip this if you’re already done this)
Clone the git repository of Tool X

git clone https://github.com/Rajkumrdusad/Tool-X.git
Now move to Tool-X directory using the cd command
Use the python install.py command to install the tool. If it doesn’t work
Run chmod +x install.aex

Or sh install.aex
Done!
